# Classic Games Python

A collection of classic game implementations built with Python and Pygame for learning and practicing game development concepts.

## About

This repository contains recreations of timeless games, designed to demonstrate fundamental game development principles and serve as educational resources for aspiring game developers.

## Games Included

### üêç Snake
A modern implementation of the classic Snake game featuring:
- Complete menu system with settings
- Configurable gameplay modes (wall collision vs wrap-around)
- High score tracking and leaderboards
- Persistent configuration system
- Comprehensive test suite

[**Play Snake ‚Üí**](snake/)

## Learning Objectives

Through these game implementations, you'll explore:

- **Game Loop Architecture** - Understanding the core update/render cycle
- **Input Handling** - Responsive and configurable control systems
- **State Management** - Menu systems, game states, and transitions
- **Collision Detection** - Efficient algorithms for game physics
- **Data Persistence** - Saving configurations and high scores
- **Code Organization** - Modular design and clean architecture
- **Testing** - Unit tests for game logic and components
- **Configuration Management** - Flexible game settings systems

## Technologies

- **Python 3.8+** - Core programming language
- **Pygame** - Game development library for graphics, sound, and input
- **JSON** - Data storage for configurations and scores
- **Pytest** - Testing framework for quality assurance
